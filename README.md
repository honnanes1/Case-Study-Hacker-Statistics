The scenario for this case study is that I am playing a game with a friend with a die at the Empire State Building. We throw the die one hundred times, if it is 1 or 2, we will go one step lower, if it's 3, 4 or 5 we will go one step higher and if it is 6, we will throw the die again. With considering the fact that there is a slight chance of falling down the stairs. With everything in mind, I bet with my friend that I'll reach 60 steps high. What are the chances I will bet?
